On Being Chinese-American

I used to be so proud of each of the shiny stickers on my purple folder labeled “J.Lam-ESL”. Jessica Lam-English Second Language. Every sticker was a new english word learned, a new grammar rule used correctly, a word spelled right. Each one represented a “fantastic” job, as my ESL teacher used to say with her big toothy smile. I soaked up her smile. In kindergarten, with little real competition individual rewards, her smile was something to strive for.

Before I entered kindergarten, I was never aware of how horrible my English was. Even now, because of my family’s encouragement, I don’t normally remember being made ashamed of my broken English. I only have a few memories that capture my battles and skirmishes against English nouns, verbs, adjectives, grammar, pronunciation.

The very first of these memories was in kindergarten. I watch my younger self in my head. I know the plot, the storyline, and I dread the moment that my younger self will muster up enough courage to raise her hand and ask a question in english. I try hard to erase that memory, and the other small lost battles, from my mind. 

It was a simple enough gesture. I was wearing a plain orange dress with white daisies on it and I sat cross-legged on the rug besides her classmates, just as apparently enthralled in the story as everyone else. The younger me seemed happily included in the class and its wonder, despite the fact that she was only one of two children who were not white. Then she raised her small hand and asked: “What does ‘empty’ mean?”

There was a pause. An already quiet classroom stilled even more. The hush stretched thinly over the shocked, incredulous faces. I cringe as I watch the other children sitting around my younger self and I see the judgement on their faces, even if my younger self doesn’t. Finally, a little boy voiced what all of them were thinking, “You don’t know what empty means?” His small sneering face effectively silenced the younger me for the rest of class.

No, I didn’t know what ‘empty’ meant. I realized then, even as a five year old, that just as I didn’t know what “empty” meant, I also didn’t know what a whole host of other english words meant. For the first time in my young life, I was ashamed not of being Chinese, but of being so obviously not American. I couldn’t keep up with the other little boys and girls in my class, despite the fact that we were all the same age, from the same place. Strangely enough, I really didn’t see any excuse for myself not to know English. 

From the moment I asked my question,  the class was suddenly divided. It became the people who knew what ‘empty’ meant, and the people who didn’t, and it was very lonely on my side of the wall. As the cliche goes, “the grass is always greener on the other side”. I thought my classmates were all smarter, and therefore superior. 

From this very young age, I had accepted my place in a larger social hierarchy. I’m sure the other kindergarteners in the class didn’t realize it, but they had accepted theirs as well. When I had raised my hand, I had exposed a weakness, a liability. My inability to speak proper english went along with an inability to keep up with other parts of American culture. I didn’t follow American sports. I didn’t eat American food. I didn’t wear the same type of clothing. I didn’t have the same family values. I didn’t celebrate certain holidays. I didn’t know a lot of things that were deemed important in the lives of the other kindergartens. And because Americans were the vast majority in that classroom, I thought the proportions in our class represented the proportions in the rest of the country, making me—  Jessica Lam, ESL student— second best in the great land of opportunity. 

To be honest, I didn’t really know how to be “#1”. I was taught never to put myself first. Who came first? My younger siblings. My elders-my grandmother, grandfather, parents, aunts, uncles. If I was ever offered anything by an adult, then I would be expected to offer it to an Elder. Then, to my siblings. Then, and only then, could I try said “thing”.

Although I say this as if I’m the only one who had to give to others first, everyone in my family was expected to do this, resulting in some strange twisted rotation of food. No one wanted to be the first one to enjoy something, and yet inwardly, we all wanted to try it. In my family, everyone was always second best. 

At home, when playing a team game, my parents always drilled it into me to let my younger siblings score. Never win by too much. Let them win. When I played soccer against my sister, four years my junior, she would always “steal” the ball from me, always “score” a goal. I would never be ahead by more than a few points, if at all. 

I don’t know how other families work, but my young kindergarten peers didn’t seem to have this same ideology sown into them as I had. They were as happy to be first as I was determined not to be. It always amazed me how people would get into such heated arguments about who “won” while I never really cared. Even now, in gym or wellness class, when people come close to tears over losing a match, I am always astonished. It is one, measly, invisible, insignificant, “point.”

I think kids in general love extolling their accomplishments. Something about being able to say, “look at what I’ve accomplished!” is just so satisfying in the short life with so few of said accomplishments. It’s why the other kindergartens always showed off their great ability to string together long complicated clauses in the English language. It’s why many of them were always so hung up over every point in every game we played. 

I guess the reason why I accepted my place was because I never had this kind of competitiveness, if you will, instilled in me. These things were measurable. In these kinds of games, it was easy to see who was the winner and who was not. 

They knew the most about American food, clothing, games, etc. They would scoff at my unsuccessful attempts to keep up. Yet even with these inadequacies, my young peers did manage to find traits to admire. They found some superficial things, sometimes cultural traditions, appealing.

What baffled me the most was their envy of the most superficial thing of all: the color of my skin. Naturally, as an Asian, I have tan skin. As one of two non-white skinned people in my kindergarten class, I wanted nothing more than to have the same skin color and be the same as everyone else. It was always strange to me that they envied my darker skin when I had always wanted lighter skin. I wondered why they would want the very trait that most separated me from them. Why would they want to trade the very thing that has saved them from countless purges and injustices? At any rate, these artificial things still made me the “winner” in these regards. 

Other things were seen as “good” in the eyes of my classmates as well. My straight hair. My black hair. My unique history. My foreign language. Yet somehow they never added up to paint a pretty picture. There were unique and appealing individual characteristics. But when pieced together, the whole puzzle was undesirable. I lost in this contest. 

My family played a very different kind of game. 

 Our family dynamic is very subtle. If you aren’t in it, you’d think we all hate each other (which we do, but only a little). There are no overt gestures of kindness or love that we did for each other.

That was another thing: we didn’t brag. Here’s another cliche: Actions speak louder than words. I think our family embraced this adage more than anything. A 100% on a test never warranted a celebration. We never said “I love you”. That’s a big thing in American society, right? That word is foreign in our mouths. Up till I was almost ten, I was too immature to say ‘love’ with a straight face. It just wasn’t a thing. It often seems to Americans that this is a cruel and oppressive way to live. But, it really isn’t. 

I used to be jealous of when my friends would get rewards for their good grades. Some got to go see movies when they made honor roll, a few got phones for achieving A’s in all their classes. For us, family life was upset only a little, if at all. Most of the time, our parents don’t even see these scores. It is only at the end of the trimester or quarter that they finally see our grades. If we see them witness it, sometimes there’s a little smile. Sometimes there’s a quiet nod. Sometimes there’s even a “good job”. And somehow that will make everything worth it. 

We did little things to show our appreciation. Nothing as overt as “I love you”. We brought tea to our family members when they were hard at work, studying, working. We remembered to put a blanket over anyone who’d fallen asleep without one. We saved fruit for someone else if they arrived late. Sometimes these little acts aren’t even acknowledged. Sometimes we even ignore them on purpose. Sometimes we yell at them. But sometimes, the other person says thank you.

“Thank you,” first and foremost, is validation. 


Finally. A similarity hidden in the long list of difference between the outgoing American and quiet Chinese culture. A universal gesture of appreciation and validation. Because who does not want validation?

The boy’s sneering face in kindergarten had been the polar opposite of validation. You know little kids, how they have a mysterious supply of energy? That comes from validation. Everywhere they go, they have adults encouraging them, teaching them, complimenting them. And from every one of these accomplishments, they get a pat on the back. It’s neverending. Perhaps as we get older, and as the validation trickles off, we lose energy. Who wants to continue doing something they don’t get appreciated for.

My ESL teacher’s smile and peppy words were always there to keep encouraging me. It was drastically different from the silent nods I received at home, but it was validation nonetheless. Even though the boy’s small face stuck with me, my ESL teacher’s encouragement stuck with me even more. I was conflicted for a while. Should I stop talking in english altogether and eliminate any risk of being ridiculed again? Or would I continue trying, to see my ESL teacher’s smile? It was a difficult decision and sometimes my decision changed on different days. 

I’ve always wished to be America. Some part of me still does. The least of which is because they have white skin and not boring straight black hair. No, it’s because it seems to me, at least from my side of the fence, that it is easier to get validation as an American. Because they give overt validation, ones that you don’t have to second guess to see if they were really there. They are obvious exclamations of congrats, or excellent, or wonderful. 

The best validation I received, however, was not in the form of any of these words. 

In third grade, surrounded by many of the same people I’d known since kindergarten, I was again sitting on a rug, listening to the teacher’s storytelling. In a simple gesture, and a simple question, a boy asked about a word I myself had been too afraid to ask about: amongst. I held my breath, and waited. 

Except this time, there was no pause, no shocked silence. The teacher immediately, genuinely, tried to answer his question, as the rest of the class attentively listened. There was no shock, no incredulousness, whatsoever. I was the only one in shock— I couldn’t believe that for once, someone else (one of the brightest people in the class, no less) had had the same question as me, jessica lam, ESL student. 

If I hadn’t been taught by my family to look for subtle validation, I might have missed this sign altogether. I could have seen it as another form of discrimination that they did not mock someone who had done the same thing I did only 2 years prior. I could have ignored it. I could have been so focused on learning the word that I missed the fact that someone else, a blond haired, blue eyed, a goodness to earth American, had asked the question. I was ecstatic: I was at least getting close to up to par. Finally. 

But, true to Chinese culture, my parents never learned of these events. We did not talk of such things. I guess because of this, it never occurred to me that I was good enough. 

I think, at least in my experience, that sometimes Americans become complacent because of their validation. Some of the Americans I know, (and I know this is a broad generalization because there are too many high achieving, driven Americans I know as well), will settle for a B or a C as a grade, as long as it is passing.

My tentative theory, is because perhaps there is a point of over-validation. Could it be that once kids get praised, they stop trying to achieve more? Of course, the converse applies as well: is there a point of under validation? Could under-validation under-motivate kids and therefore cause them to under-achieve? 

This is part of the reason I cringe when people say “so and so is so ‘smart’”. What does that mean? According to stereotypical Chinese expectations, that might mean being valedictorian. In stereotypical American terms, it might mean above average. 

This conflict of expectations is the main problem of being traditional Chinese in a very white, very American town. Which set of standards do you follow? That of your family, or that of the majority surrounding you?

But I guess I already answered that question in kindergarten. The boy’s sneering face had set the standard long before I knew it. 

At that moment, I had hated him. He had called me out. He had pulled wide the curtain in front of my thinly veiled ignorance. He had clearly laid out my future for me, had I chosen to take it. I could have been ignorant forever. I could utterly rejected the English language even as I clung tighter to my own native language. His standard for me was unmistakable: that I was inferior and would perpetually be inferior.

 But that didn’t happen. I probably like to think I’ve made more progress than I actually have, but progress is as unmistakable as the fact that that little boy’s standard was reached and broken. He had dangled an apple for me just out of reach, and the standard for me has forever remained just out of reach. In my endeavors to reach the fabulous prize of making the standard, I had long ago crossed the line, even if I had not known it. And for thank, I thank the little boy, sneering face and all.
